# pandas-challenge

This is the ReadMe for my Module 4 Challenge on Pandas. I have worked on this assignment primarily as an individual while seeking help from my instructor and group members in the areas surrounding Cells 3 and 4 on finding totals, as well as Cells 12 and beyond where groupby and .first functions were used. My analysis is provided at the top of my Jupyter Notebook file. Summary images are provided in the Gallery folder.
